## Usage

The `LandingCTA` component will wrap your content in a [Card](https://ui.nuxt.com/components/card){:target="\_blank"}.

Use the `title`, `description` and `icon` props to customize the content of card.

```vue [example.vue]
<template>
  <ULandingCTA
    title="Trusted and supported by our amazing community"
    description="We've built a strong, lasting partnership. Their trust is our driving force, propelling us towards shared success."
    card
  />
</template>
```

::callout{icon="heroicons:light-bulb"}
You can disable its border and card style by setting the `card` prop to `false`.
::

You can add anything you want in the default slot, a gradient or an image for example (this will render better on full-screen).

You can change the `align` prop from `center` to `left` or `right` to position the slot horizontaly.

```vue [example.vue]
<template>
  <ULandingCTA
    title="Join us"
    description="Incididunt fugiat duis in."
    align="left"
    card
  >
    <img
      src="https://picsum.photos/640/360"
      class="w-full rounded-md shadow-xl ring-1 ring-gray-300 dark:ring-gray-700"
    />
  </ULandingCTA>
</template>
```

Use the `links` prop to add some [Buttons](https://ui.nuxt.com/components/button){:target="\_blank"} below the description.

```vue [example.vue]
<template>
  <ULandingCTA
    title="Trusted and supported by our amazing community"
    description="We've built a strong, lasting partnership. Their trust is our driving force, propelling us towards shared success."
    card
    :links="[
      { label: 'Get started', color: 'gray', size: 'md' },
      {
        label: 'Learn more',
        variant: 'link',
        color: 'gray',
        size: 'md',
        trailingIcon: 'i-heroicons-arrow-right-20-solid',
      },
    ]"
  />
</template>
```

This component can be put directly inside a [LandingSection](/ui/components/landing-section) or a [Container](https://ui.nuxt.com/components/container){:target="\_blank"} directly with its content fetched from `@nuxt/content` easily:

```yml [content/index.yml]
cta:
  title: Trusted and supported by our amazing community
  description: We've built a strong, lasting partnership. Their trust is our driving force, propelling us towards shared success.
  links:
    - label: "Get started"
      color: "gray"
      size: "md"
    - label: "Learn more"
      variant: "link"
      color: "gray"
      size: "md"
      trailingIcon: "i-heroicons-arrow-right-20-solid"
```

::callout{icon="heroicons:exclamation-circle"}
We're using `.yml` files as an example here but you can use any format supported by `@nuxt/content` like `.md` or `.json`.
::

```vue [pages/index.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const { data: page } = await useAsyncData("index", () =>
  queryContent("/").findOne()
);
</script>

<template>
  <ULandingSection>
    <ULandingCTA v-bind="page.cta" card />
  </ULandingSection>
</template>
```
