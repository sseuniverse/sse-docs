## Usage

Built on top of the [Slideover](https://ui.nuxt.com/components/slideover){:target="_blank"} component, the `DashboardSlideover` contains a header, body and footer.

Its header matches exactly the [DashboardNavbar](/ui/components/dashboard-navbar) and contains a close button matching the [DashboardModal](/ui/components/dashboard-modal) and [DashboardSearch](/ui/components/dashboard-search).

Its body is a scrollable container with some padding to display your content and its footer is placed at the bottom of the slideover.

Use the `title` prop to customize the slideover.

```vue [example.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const open = ref(true)

// This is a hack to keep the slideover open
watch(open, (value) => {
  if (!value) {
    setTimeout(() => open.value = true, 1000)
  }
})
</script>

<template>
  <UDashboardSlideover v-model="open" title="Notifications" />
</template>
```
