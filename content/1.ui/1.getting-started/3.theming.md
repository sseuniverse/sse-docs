description: Learn how to customize SSE Nuxt UI components.

As Nuxt UI Pro is built on top of Nuxt UI, you should check out the Nuxt UI [Theming](https://ui.nuxt.com/getting-started/theming){:target="\_blank"} page first. This is where you'll learn how to choose the `primary` and `gray` colors or the icons collections to use for example.

## Components

Like in Nuxt UI, every component is prefixed with a `U` to avoid conflicts with other components. For example, the [Header](/ui/components/header) component is named `UHeader`.

You can customize components the same way as `@nuxt/ui`, through the [App Config](https://ui.nuxt.com/getting-started/theming#appconfigts){:target="\_blank"} or [ui prop](https://ui.nuxt.com/getting-started/theming#ui-prop){:target="\_blank"} , both of which are smartly merged thanks to [tailwind-merge](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge){:target="\_blank"} . In the same way, when using the `class` prop on any component, it will also automatically be merged with the `wrapper`.

```js
const config = {
  wrapper: "flex flex-col lg:grid gap-8 lg:grid-cols-12 relative",
};
```

If you use a `class` as such: `<ULandingGrid class="lg:grid-cols-10" />`, it will be merged with the `wrapper` class and the grid will have 10 columns instead of 12.
You can achieve the same thing using the `app.config.ts` in the `ui` object:

```ts [app.config.ts]
export default defineAppConfig({
  ui: {
    landing: {
      grid: {
        wrapper: "lg:grid-cols-10",
      },
    },
  },
});
```

## Variables

A new `variables` key is available in the `ui` object to override some variables used in Nuxt UI Pro. By default, the following variables are used:

```ts [app.config.ts]
export default defineAppConfig({
  ui: {
    variables: {
      light: {
        background: "255 255 255",
        foreground: "var(--color-gray-700)",
      },
      dark: {
        background: "var(--color-gray-900)",
        foreground: "var(--color-gray-200)",
      },
      header: {
        height: "4rem",
      },
    },
  },
});
```

The `background` and `foreground` variables are transformed into colors and used in some components. They are also automatically applied to the `body` element so you don't have to:

```css
body {
  @apply antialiased font-sans text-foreground bg-background;
}
```

The `header.height` variable is used to set the height of the `Header` component. Some other components like `Aside`, `Main`, `ContentToc`, etc. also use it to position themselves accordingly.

New variables might be added in the future! Feel free to submit an issue if you feel like something is missing.

## Icons

A new `icons` key is available in the `ui` object to override some icons used in Nuxt UI Pro. By default, the following icons are used:

```ts [app.config.ts]
export default defineAppConfig({
  ui: {
    icons: {
      dark: "i-heroicons-moon-20-solid",
      light: "i-heroicons-sun-20-solid",
      system: "i-heroicons-computer-desktop-20-solid",
      search: "i-heroicons-magnifying-glass-20-solid",
      external: "i-heroicons-arrow-up-right-20-solid",
      chevron: "i-heroicons-chevron-down-20-solid",
      hash: "i-heroicons-hashtag-20-solid",
      menu: "i-heroicons-bars-3-20-solid",
      close: "i-heroicons-x-mark-20-solid",
      check: "i-heroicons-check-circle-20-solid",
    },
  },
});
```

Those are only shortcuts, you can still override them specifically:

```ts [app.config.ts]
export default defineAppConfig({
  ui: {
    header: {
      links: {
        trailingIcon: {
          name: "i-ph-caret-down", // Defaults to `ui.icons.chevron`
        },
      },
      button: {
        icon: {
          open: "i-ph-list",
          close: "i-ph-x",
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

Note that those shortcuts are used for icons that are repeated across components, like the `dark` and `light` icons used in `ColorModeButton`, `ColorModeToggle` and `ContentSearch` components for example. Other icons like the `ui.header.button` shown above need to be overridden specifically.
