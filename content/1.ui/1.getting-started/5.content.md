description: Learn how @nuxt/content module integrates with SSE Nuxt UI.
---

When building a landing page, a documentation, a blog or even a changelog you will need to manage content. You can do it manually by creating a new page for each content, fetch it from a CMS, store in your own database, etc. or use the `@nuxt/content` module to manage your content with Git.

::callout
Take a look at Nuxt Studio, the Pro version of @nuxt/content which is fully compatible with @nuxt/ui-pro.
::

## Installation

To get started, you can follow the [official guide](https://content.nuxt.com/get-started/installation/){:target="\_blank"} or in summary:

::code-group

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm install @nuxt/content
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @nuxt/content
```

```bash [npm]
npm install @nuxt/content
```

::

Then add the module to your `nuxt.config.ts`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  extends: ["@nuxt/ui-pro"],
  modules: ["@nuxt/content", "@nuxt/ui"],
});
```

::callout{icon="iconify heroicons:exclamation-triangle" color="#DFAC26"}
You need to register `@nuxt/content` before `@nuxt/ui` otherwise Tailwind CSS classes won't be parsed in your `.md` and `.yml` files
::

Now that `@nuxt/content` module is installed, the layer will automatically configure the syntax `highlight` theme with `material-theme` and preload some languages so you don't have to.

## Components

You might be using `@nuxt/content` to build a documentation. To help you with that, we've built some components that you can use in your pages:

- a full-text search command palette out of the box with the [ContentSearch](/components/content-search) component. No need to setup Algolia DocSearch anymore.
- a sticky Table of Contents with the [ContentToc](/components/content-toc) component
- a prev / next navigation with the [ContentSurround](/components/content-surround) component

## Typography

To make the most out of `@nuxt/content`, we use the [`@tailwindcss/typography`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin){:target="\_blank"} plugin to style your content. The defaults of the plugin have been overriden to use the `primary` and `gray` colors from your [App Config](https://ui.nuxt.com/getting-started/theming#appconfigts) alongside many other customizations so it matches the design system of Nuxt UI.

You will be able to wrap your `<ContentSlot />` or `<ContentRenderer />` with the [PageBody](/components/page-body) component and its `prose` class to apply the` prose prose-primary dark:prose-invert max-w-none` classes automatically to your content and make it look great.

To help you when writing content, we've also added some components to use in your `.md` files using the [MDC syntax](https://content.nuxt.com/usage/markdown/) like a [Callout](/prose/callout), [Card](/prose/card), [CodeGroup](/pprose/code-group), [Tabs](/prose/tabs), etc.

## Utils

Some utils will be auto-imported to make the bridge between `@nuxt/content` and `@sse-ui/nuxt`:

### `mapContentNavigation`

This util will map the navigation from `fetchContentNavigation` that you'll usually fetch in your `app.vue` file and transform it recursively into an array of objects expected by components like [NavigationTree](https://content.nuxt.com/composables/fetch-content-navigation){:target="\_blank"}.

```vue [app.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const { data: navigation } = await useAsyncData(
  "navigation",
  () => fetchContentNavigation(),
  { default: () => [] }
);
</script>

<template>
  <UHeader>
    <template #panel>
      <UNavigationTree :links="mapContentNavigation(navigation)" />
    </template>
  </UHeader>
</template>
```

### `findPageHeadline`

This util will allow you to bind an `headline` in the [PageHeader](/components/page-header) based on the page `_dir`.

```vue [pages/[slug\\].vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const route = useRoute();

const { data: page } = await useAsyncData(route.path, () =>
  queryContent(route.path).findOne()
);

const headline = computed(() => findPageHeadline(page.value));
</script>

<template>
  <UPage>
    <UPageHeader v-bind="page" :headline="headline" />
  </UPage>
</template>
```

### `findPageBreadcrumb`

This util will recursively find the breadcrumb of a page based on the navigation so you can use it in the [PageHeader](/components/page-header) `#headline `slot.

```vue [app.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const { data: navigation } = await useAsyncData("navigation", () =>
  fetchContentNavigation()
);

provide("navigation", navigation);
</script>
```

```vue [pages/[slug\\].vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
import type { NavItem } from "@nuxt/content";

const navigation = inject<Ref<NavItem[]>>("navigation", ref([]));

const route = useRoute();

const { data: page } = await useAsyncData(route.path, () =>
  queryContent(route.path).findOne()
);

const breadcrumb = computed(() =>
  mapContentNavigation(findPageBreadcrumb(navigation.value, page.value))
);
</script>

<template>
  <UPage>
    <UPageHeader v-bind="page">
      <template #headline>
        <UBreadcrumb :links="breadcrumb" />
      </template>
    </UPageHeader>
  </UPage>
</template>
```
